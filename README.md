# Welcome to Arithmetic-Sequence !!!

A Python module for finding arithmetic sequences for a given sequence.  
Just enter a list and get back all arithmetic sequences from it! üöÄ

## What does the script do?

Module returns a list of lists that contain arithmetic sequences found in the entered list

## `arithmeticSequences(A,n)` :
arithmeticSequences(A,n) returns a list of lists of all arithmetic sequences from list `A` with common difference `n` or all common differences if n = 0. This includes subsequences of existing sequences.  
An arithmetic sequence is valid only if it has more then 2 items.

## `distArSeq(A,n)` :
distArSeq(A,n) returns a list of lists of distinct arithmetic sequences from list `A` with common difference `n` or all common differences if n = 0.  
distArSeq(A,n) returns a list that has no arithmetic sequences that are a subsequence of an existing sequence.  
An arithmetic sequence is valid only if it has more then 2 items.

## How to use it
#### 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/StokicDusan/Arithmetic-Sequence.git
$ cd Arithmetic-Sequence/
```
--->

## Examples
```python
>>> import arithmeticSequence as ASE

>>> arSeq = [61,10,11,30,21,20,40,41,50,60,1,70]
>>> ASE.distArSeq(arSeq)
[[1, 11, 21], [1, 21, 41, 61], [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70], [10, 30, 50, 70], [10, 40, 70], [20, 40, 60]]
>>> ASE.distArSeq(arSeq,20)
[[1, 21, 41, 61], [10, 30, 50, 70], [20, 40, 60]]

>>> arSeq = [2,10,17,24,31,38,45,52,60]
>>> ASE.distArSeq(arSeq)
[[2, 31, 60], [10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52], [10, 24, 38, 52], [10, 31, 52], [17, 31, 45]]
>>> ASE.distArSeq(arSeq,7)
[[10, 17, 24, 31, 38, 45, 52]]
>>> ASE.distArSeq(arSeq,11)
[]

>>> arSeq = [1,10,30,40,80,110]
>>> ASE.distArSeq(arSeq)
[]
```
